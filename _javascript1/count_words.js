// This has three functions. The first function, init(), runs when the page finishes loading. We say "init() is the load event handler." Now that you know a bit more about functions, take another look at how we assign a function to the window.onload property. We write:

// window.onload = init;

// We don't write:

// window.onload = init();

// Why? You know the answer to this now, right? Because when we write init(), we're calling the function init, which we don't want to do. We want JavaScript to call it for us, after the load event has been triggered, which the browser does for us when it finishes loading the page. We use a load event handler so we can access the DOM safelyâ€”that is, only after the page has finished loading. If we typed window.onload = init();, then JavaScript would try to run the init() function as soon as it saw that line of code, which is too soon. By assigning window.onload to the function name, we let JavaScript run the function when the page is ready.

// In init(), we set up a button click handler, so the getSentence() function is called when you click the button. And here, we say "getSentence() is the click handler for the button." This works exactly like window.onload does; we want JavaScript to call the getSentence() function only when we click the button, which generates a click event, so we use the function name when we assign the click event handler to the button.

// Setting up handlers like this is something you'll do often in your JavaScript code. Many events, like click and load, have corresponding properties, like onclick and onload, that you can use to set them up.



window.onload = init;

function init() {
  var button = document.getElementById("submit");
  button.onclick = getSentence;
}
function getSentence(){
  var sentenceInput = document.getElementById("sentence");
  var sentence = sentenceInput.value;
  if (sentence == null || sentence == ""){
    alert("Please enter some words!")
  }
  else {
    var howManyWords = countWords(sentence);
    alert(howManyWords + " words in the sentence.")
  }
}
function countWords(sentence){
  var words = sentence.split(" ");
  var numWords = words.length;
  return numWords;
}

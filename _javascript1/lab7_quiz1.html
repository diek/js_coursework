      <em>Flask is a microframework for Python based on Werkzeug, Jinja 2 and good intentions. And before you ask: It's BSD licensed!</em>
      </p>
      <blockquote><em>Welcome to Flask’s documentation. This documentation is divided into different parts. I recommend that you get started with Installation and then head over to the Quickstart. Besides the quickstart, there is also a more detailed Tutorial that shows how to create a complete (albeit small) application with Flask. If you’d rather dive into the internals of Flask, check out the API documentation. Common patterns are described in the Patterns for Flask section.</em>
